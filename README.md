# 🚀 Mars Autonomous AI Assistant

## 🌌 Overview
Mars Autonomous AI Assistant is an onboard artificial intelligence system designed to solve one of the biggest challenges in interplanetary missions — communication delay between Mars and Earth.

Due to the 4–25 minute signal delay, astronauts cannot rely on real-time instructions from Earth. This AI system provides autonomous decision support directly inside the spacecraft.

## ❗ Problem
Communication between Mars and Earth takes from 4 to 25 minutes one way.  

In emergency or critical situations:
- Astronauts cannot wait for instructions.
- Manual decision-making increases risk.
- Delays can cost lives.

## 💡 Solution
The Mars AI Assistant:
- Analyzes spacecraft data in real time  
- Detects anomalies and risks  
- Suggests safe actions  
- Provides emergency protocols  
- Communicates in natural language  

The AI acts as a co-pilot and safety advisor.
